````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Things I learned
- How to create and build a jupyter book.
- How to customize and organiza a jupyter book. 
- How to edit text using both Markdown and html.
- How to add interesting features such as hiding code lines and cross referencing.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Figuring out the conflicting kernel error with the analysis_example.ipynb file in Question 6.
- Figuring out what to do with the table of contents in intro.md since the table of contents line was already in the file.
- Having to clean the cache and rebuild the book every time a change was made to see if it worked was a bit cumbersome.  It would be nice if the changes could be previewed in jupyter lab.
